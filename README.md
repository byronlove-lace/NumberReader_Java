This Java program, NumberReader, reads a list of integers from the user, processes the input, identifies invalid entries (like non-numeric characters or numbers out of a specific range), removes duplicates, and provides options to save the cleaned data to a file, read data from a file, sort the cleaned numbers, or exit the program.

I used this program to learn about user input handling, string manipulation, file I/O operations, error handling and enumeration in Java.
